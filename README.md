Plants exhibit an alternation of generations: two distinct multicellular phases—the sporophyte and the gametophyte—that differ in ploidy, function, structure, and ecological/phylogenetic prominence.

Key differences

Ploidy and origin
Sporophyte: diploid (2n). Develops from the zygote produced by fusion of gametes.
Gametophyte: haploid (n). Develops from a haploid spore produced by meiosis in the sporophyte.
Primary function
Sporophyte: produces spores by meiosis (sporangia). Its role is propagation through spore formation and dispersal.
Gametophyte: produces gametes by mitosis (antheridia and archegonia or pollen/ovules in seed plants). Its role is sexual reproduction and fertilization.
Mode of reproduction
Sporophyte: sexual phase generates haploid spores via meiosis.
Gametophyte: sexual phase generates gametes (sperm and eggs) via mitosis.
Morphology and independence (varies by plant group)
Nonvascular plants (bryophytes: mosses, liverworts, hornworts)
Dominant gametophyte: large, photosynthetic, free-living.
Sporophyte: usually smaller, physiologically dependent on gametophyte, often attached.
Seedless vascular plants (ferns and lycophytes)
Dominant sporophyte: large, independent, photosynthetic.
Gametophyte: small, free-living (prothallus), short-lived.
Seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms)
Dominant sporophyte: large, independent.
Gametophyte: highly reduced and dependent—microscopic (pollen grains = male gametophytes; embryo sac = female gametophyte).
Size and complexity
Sporophyte: generally larger and more structurally complex in vascular plants; may form full plant body with roots, stems, leaves.
Gametophyte: generally smaller and simpler, often a few cells in seed plants, a small thallus in ferns, the main plant body in bryophytes.
Duration and visibility
Sporophyte: often long-lived (perennial trees, ferns).
Gametophyte: often ephemeral or microscopic, especially in seed plants.
Illustrative lifecycle sequence (simplified)

Sporophyte (2n) produces haploid spores by meiosis in sporangia.
Spores germinate into gametophytes (n).
Gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis.
Gametes fuse (fertilization) to form a diploid zygote (2n).
Zygote develops into the sporophyte; cycle repeats.
Functional consequences

Evolutionary trend: reduction of the gametophyte and dominance of the sporophyte correlates with adaptation to terrestrial life (protection of the embryo, dispersal efficiency, and internal fertilization mechanisms).
Genetic implications: alternation ensures genetic recombination (meiosis) and expression of haploid selection (gametophyte stage exposes recessive alleles to selection).
Summary
The sporophyte is the diploid, spore-producing generation; the gametophyte is the haploid, gamete-producing generation. Their relative prominence, independence, size, and complexity vary across plant groups—from gametophyte-dominant bryophytes to sporophyte-dominant vascular and seed plants.

A slightly different approach . . .

Gamete = sex cell (haploid, or ½ of each chromosome); gametophyte = gamete-producing plant (or part of a plant).

Spore = non-sex cell (diploid or both halves of each chromosome); sporophyte = non-sex-cell-producing plant (vegetative parts of plants, producing diploid spores).

The evolutionary trend is for the gametophyte generation to become a smaller, or less visible part of the plant species’ life cycle. For example, in some plants considered to be more “primitive” gametophyte and sporophyte generations are entirely different plants, one producing spores, the

This is my answer to a previous question. Are mosses homosporous or heterosporous? What about ferns? And why?

I think it also answers this question. What is the difference between sporophyte and gametophyte?

In plants, meiosis produces haploid nuclei that become spores. Spores then grow into haploid entities called gametophytes that produce gametes by cell differentiation. When the spores are all the same size, that plant is called homosporous (the prefix “homo” means same) and the resulting gametophytes produce both male and female gametes. Some plants produce spores of different sizes, large s

A gametophyte is a haploid multicellular plant or alga that produces gametes by mitosis. Two gametes fuse by syngamy to produce a diploid zygote, which develops into a sporophyte.

A sporophyte is a diploid multicellular plant or alga that produces meiospores by meiosis. Each haploid meiospore is capable of developing into a gametophyte.

Gametes originates from greek “gamos” meaning mating, mix together (= amal-gamate), sexual intercourse. A bi- or poly-gamist has two or more sexual partners. Therefore a gametophyte is where “it” happens: spermatozoids out of bottle-shaped “Archegonia” swimm towards the much bigger egg-cell inside the “Oogonium” which may be on a different plant or on the same thallus (= a lobe-shaped leafy structure). After successful mating the offspring has double genom and is called a diplont. These are usually more successful and adapt better to environmental conditions. That’s why the diploid phase of a

How do you identify the gametophyte stage in the life cycle of a fern or moss?
The gametophyte of a moss looks like a green shoot with needle-like leaves. As non-vascular plants, though, the gametophytes do not have true leaves and stems.


Most gametophytes of ferns are simple, non-vascular plants that grow prostrate on the substrate.

What is the gametophyte in bryophytes known as?
The gametophyte in the bryophytes is known as dominant stage because it exists for longer time than sporophyte stage of the life cycle.
The predominant gametophyte stage is initiated with germination of haploid single spore.

The gametophyte of bryophytes generally have two stages:-
1) Protonema stage - It is creeping, green and branched and frequently filaments. It develop directly from a haploid spore. The chief role of this juvenile stage is vegetative. It bears no sex organs.
2) Leafy stage - It arises as lateral buds from the Protonema in musci. This stage finally produces sex organs i.e.

How does the gametophyte/sporophyte cycle work?

I think I answered a question similar to this before. Basically, all plants reproduce sexually by meiosis and syngamy. Starting from the zygote (which is the diploid product of syngamy - the fusion of the egg nucleus with the sperm nucleus), the zygote grows and develops into the adult diploid plant. It is an adult because there are structures (sporangia) with diploid nuclei that can undergo meiosis. The products of meiosis are four haploid nuclei that, in plants, are called spores. These spores grow and develop into a haploid adult “plant.” It is

Which stage occur first (gametophyte or sporophyte) in plant development? What is the basic difference between them?
The stages of plant depend upon different plant groups and thus vary from plant to pllant.

In Angiosperm

The adult, or sporophyte, phase is the main phase of an angiosperm's life cycle. As with gymnosperms, angiosperms are heterosporous. Therefore, they generate microspores, which will produce pollen grains as the male gametophytes, and megaspores, which will form an ovule that contains female gametophytes.

In Gymnosperms

The gymnosperms are classified into four separate divisions, viz. the Coniferophyta, Gnetophyta, Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta. Of these, the Coniferophyta represents the largest g

Why is it that the sporophyte and gametophyte are respectively called haploid and daploid?
You have it backwards. The sporophyte in diploid and the gametophyte is haploid. The sporophyte develops from a fertilized egg cell (zygote). When mature, the cells in the reproductive organs of the sporophyte undergo reductive cell division called meiosis to produce haploid cell called spores. The spores germinate and develop into the gametophyte which produces eggs and sperm, which united to form another zygote. This process, which is common to all plants, is called “alternation of generations” because the life cycle alternates between a diploid sporophyte and a haploid gametophyte.

What is the relationship of the fern gametophyte and sporophyte?
Alternation of generation in a fern plant is characterised by the existence of two distinct generations in its life cycle namely sporophyte and gametophyte generation. The fern plant belongs to a sporophyte generation (dominant)as it produces spores.

The spore germinates and develops into a prothallus- a heart shaped minute structure-which produces two types of gametes hence it is referred to as gametophyte generation. The prothallus has a male gamete producing structures called antheridia and female gamete producing structures called archegonia. The male gamete(sperm/antherozoid) fuses with th

Can you explain why some plants have both gametophyte (haploid) and sporophyte (diploid)?
All plants have life cycles involving an alternation of generations that include both a sporophytic stage (Diploid), and a gametophytic stage (Haploid).

In the non-vascular plants, the gametophyte is the prominent, free-living stage.

In seed plants, the sporophyte is the prominent, free-living stage, and the gametophytes are reduced to pollen grains and tissues enclosed in the ovule.

In vascular, non-seed bearing plants such as ferns, both the sporophyte and gametophyte are free-living.

How is plant reproduction similar to animal reproduction? How is it different?
Plants have an alternation of generations. Animals do not. We are all familiar with animal reproduction. Animals are diploid and produce haploid gametes through meiosis. These come together in fertilization to produce a diploid zygote that undergoes mitosis to produce an embryo. The embryo develops into the animal organisms with which we are familiar. There is only one organismal stage and it is diploid. In plants, there are two organismal stages: a diploid stage called a Sporophyte, and a haploid stage called a Gametophyte. Sporophytes produce haploid spores through meiosis that undergo mitosis to produce a gametophyte. Gametophytes produce gametes through mitosis (like in animals these are sperm and egg), that undergo fertilization to produce a diploid zygote that undergoes mitosis to form an embryo that grows into a Sporophyte plant. In the non-vascular plants, the gametophyte is the stage with which we are most familiar. Common moss plants are gametophytes and are haploid. In vascular plants that do not form seeds we see both free living gametophytes and sporophytes. Fern plants are sporophytes. However, if you sow their spores on an extremely moist substrate, they will form photosynthetic free-living gametophytes. These are non-vascular. They will produce gametes through mitosis that will undergo fertilization to form an embryo which grows into the free-living plant with which we are familiar. In seed plants, the gametophytes are reduced and not obvious. They have female gametophytes in their ovules. Ovules go on to produce seeds. Pollen grains are the male gametophytes. In summary: Animals produce gametes through meiosis. They do not produce spores. Plants produce gametes through mitosis and spores through meiosis.

How can you relate the sporophyte to those of bryophytes in terms of evolutionary trends?
Organisms with independent free-living diploid stages (with sporophytes), and free living haploid stages (with gametophytes) are interesting in that each stage has to make a living. Some species with an alternation of generations, such as Sea Lettuce (Ulva), are morphologically the same (except for the reproductive structures) and essentially occupy the same ecological niche. However, many species with an alternation of generations (and all plant species), have dramatically different sporophytes and gametophytes. For these species, each stage must successfully fill a different ecological niche. This is similar to the situation to animals that undergo metamorphosis. Frogs and tadpoles, beetles and grubs, caterpillars and butterflies are all diploid, but the two stages of their life cycle fill different ecological niches. Failure of one stage to make a living in its environment will result in extinction of the species. In plants with free-living sporophytes and gametophytes, both stages are also acted on by a different set of environmental challenges. Each stage must adapt to its given environment for these species to survive. One exception that proves the rule is a fern that grows in the Appalachians. This species does not have a sporophytic stage. It is in a genus of tropical ferns, and sporophytes of this genus cannot survive freezing temperatures of winter. The gametophytes, however, are prostrate and occupy places that are perpetually wet and do not freeze. In the case of this species, it survives only through the vegetative reproduction of its gametophytes, but has relinquished sexual reproduction. In plants, where we see a dependence of one stage on the other, one can consider the dual organism as one in terms of natural selection. In the bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), the gametophyte is the predominant stage and the sporophyte is dependent and attached. If the gametophyte survives so does the sporophyte. In the seed plants, the gametophytes are totally dependent on the sporophytes, and if the sporophyte succeeds, so will the gametophyte. The critical issue here is the successful transfer of the male gametophytes (pollination). In seed plants, adaptations are found in both the gametophyte and sporophyte to ensure successful pollination.

Equisetum sporophytes are vascular plants that produce strobili. Their strobili consist of modified stems called sporangiophores which bear sporangia. Sporangia produce spores by meiosis. These spores are green, and are easy to germinate on an appropriate medium. The spores grow into photosynthetic, free living gametophytes. The black arrows point to two developing sporophytes: These gametophytes produce eggs and sperm by mitosis. After fertilization, the sporophyte grows attached to the gametophyte and is nourished by it. The sporophytes then become independent perennial plants.

How do the sporophyte stage and gametophyte stage make a cycle?
Sporophyte and gametophyte are two separate plant growth stages. They alternate with each other in the life cycle of a single-celled organism.

This is called alternation of generations . The alternation of generations means that the sporophyte is replaced by gametophyte.

If a fertilized egg develops into a sporophyte, then it becomes a diploid multi celled organism. The sporophyte produces large diploid cells that are stored in a thick-walled sporangium and become spores.

Sporangia are usually produced at the ends of stalks that go out from the gametophyte. The sporangium becomes ripe, and the sp
